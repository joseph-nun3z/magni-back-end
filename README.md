#####The Idea 

Imagine that you have like 2 hours of free time and you want to get healthy so you thought \
"I could go for a walk!" but then you say "I need to be at work/home/etc by [insert time]" \
and you don't have an idea how much time would take you to walk around or you don't any \
routes that fits your schedule, here's come the magni-app (name still subject to changes). \
Using machine learning the magni-app would be able to generate a route taking all your\
worries into account, and you'll be sure to get back in time!
